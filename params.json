{"name":"Teaching Editor","body":"Teaching Editor\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis project provides an online editor that automatically reloads the\r\ncontents of an iPhone-sized frame. It also provides students with a\r\nread-only mode, allowing them to follow in real time whatever code is\r\nwritten in the screen of the teacher, and they can also download the\r\ncurrent state of the code at any moment.\r\n\r\nIt is built exclusively in JavaScript, using the following libraries:\r\n\r\n- [Ace][1]\r\n- [Ext.js][2]\r\n- [Node.js][3]\r\n- [Express][4]\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Teaching\r\nEditor](https://github.com/akosmasoftware/TeachingEditor/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\nUse [Homebrew][6] to install [Node.js][3] in your system. Also, install\r\n[npm][9] and install [Express][4] and [Socket.IO][11] with npm.\r\n\r\nThe `install.sh` script performs all the required operations to install\r\nexternal dependencies in your system.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n\r\nThe client has been tested successfully on several combinations of\r\noperating systems and browsers:\r\n\r\n- Cross-platform browsers:\r\n    - Firefox 10\r\n    - Chrome 17 \r\n    - Opera 11\r\n- OS X \"Lion\"\r\n    - Safari 5.1\r\n- Windows 7\r\n    - Internet Explorer 9\r\n- iOS\r\n    - Mobile Safari for iOS 5.1 on the iPad (in this case, however,\r\n      scrolling is not possible)\r\n\r\nPay attention to the fact that the mobile libraries themselves might not\r\nbe compatible with some of these browsers (in particular, Sencha Touch\r\nonly works on Webkit-based browsers).\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- `./install.sh` (this will download the required libraries, only\r\n  required once)\r\n- `./launch.js` (this launches the Node.js app and opens a browser\r\n  window)\r\n- Students can browse to the IP shown in the dialog of the \"Project /\r\n  Show Share URL\" menu entry.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis project is released under the GPLv3 license.
